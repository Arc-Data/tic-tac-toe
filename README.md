# tic-tac-toe

Following TheOdinProject's Full Stack JavaScript Course. Definitely the time to step up my learnings with modules and factory functions! Player vs Player only, will come back in the future to implement a Player vs. AI mode!

My learnings:

- I had to research alot about why should I not use classes and such when I dove in to this project.
- To me, this definitely felt like how I was stumped for a while before being able to make sense of what I should do for my calculator. I learned (and how it might be the wrong way to do it) to just type in what you know and try to make sense of it later on. Do not be afraid of making do-overs because that was what made me be able to make sense of what it is that I should do.
